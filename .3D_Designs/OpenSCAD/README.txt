# Summary

This is a stepper motor mount for OpenBeam.  The customization parameters include a choice of parallel or perpendicular mounting, NEMA 8 to NEMA 42 motor sizes (because I have way too many surplus motors), and specification of other beam/extrusion sizes.

STL versions are included for some common motor sizes (NEMA 17, 14, 11, 23).

This component is inspired by the [Open-source optics project](http://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_optics), whose goal is to radically reduce the cost of scientific optical hardware, by the [Michigan Tech's Open Sustainability Technology Research Group](http://www.mse.mtu.edu/MOST).

# Custom Section

OpenSCAD code included for modifications. Just print on your favorite 3D printer and clean up. For stability/strength, this part may need 30% or more infill. The parallel version can print without supports, but the perpendicular version will need some supports.

You'll need appropriate bolts to attach the motor, and 4x M3 bolts and nuts to attach to the OpenBeam.
